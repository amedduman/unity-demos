## Project: Unity Visual Scripting Tool Prototype

### Description:
In this project, I conceptualized and prototyped a Visual Scripting Tool using Unity's GraphView API and UI Toolkit. The tool empowers users to perform basic operations through a visual, node-based interface, enhancing the efficiency of scripting workflows.

### Key Features:

* GraphView API Integration: Leveraged Unity's GraphView API to create a dynamic and interactive node-based graph interface.
* UI Toolkit Implementation: Utilized UI Toolkit for a streamlined and customizable user interface, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing user experience.
* Basic Operations: Developed functionality for fundamental operations within the visual scripting tool, providing a glimpse into its potential applications.


### Technologies Used:

* Unity Game Development Engine
* C# Programming Language
* GraphView API
* UI Toolkit

### Outcome:
This Visual Scripting Tool Prototype showcases the initial capabilities of a node-based scripting interface, emphasizing simplicity and usability. Users can quickly grasp the tool's potential for simplifying complex scripting tasks through visual representation.

### Future Improvements:
Looking ahead, I plan to further refine and expand the tool's functionality. Future improvements may include adding advanced operations, improving the user interface, and incorporating user feedback for a more robust and versatile tool.
